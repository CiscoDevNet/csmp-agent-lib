# Wi-SUN - SoC Network Measurement

The Wi-SUN Network Measurement application provides a performance measurement solution based on the ping and iPerf mechanisms. This application leverages the LCD screen to be used without any additional device or console access, and also provides a CLI for convenience.

## Getting Started

To get started with Wi-SUN and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG181: Wi-SUN SDK Quick Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg181-wi-sun-sdk-quick-start-guide.pdf).

The SoC term stands for "System on Chip", meaning that this is a standalone application running on the EFR32 without any external MCU required.

To get started with the example, follow the steps below:

* Flash the "Wi-SUN Border Router" demonstration to a device and start the Border Router.
* Create and build the Wi-SUN - SoC Network Measurement project.
* Flash the Wi-SUN Network Measurement project to a second device.
* Wait for the connection to complete.

* When the main menu appears, you can start iPerf and Ping tests.
* Use either the LCD screen and push buttons or the CLI to interact with the ping test tool.
* Use either the LCD screen and push buttons or the CLI to execute iPerf tests.
* Use CoAP remote CLI interface to trigger ping and iPerf tests, or get neighbor information.
* Use either the LCD and pushbuttons or the CLI to change PHY (both FAN 1.0 and FAN1.1 are supported)

For additional information and guidelines, refer to the dedicated application note: [AN1364: Wi-SUN Network Performance Measurement Application](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1364-wi-sun-network-performance-measurement-app.pdf).

## Troubleshooting

Before programming the radio board mounted on the WSTK, ensure the power supply switch is in the AEM position (right side), as shown.
