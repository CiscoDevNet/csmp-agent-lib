 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 * CSMP Device side library.
 *
 * The CSMP Device Library exist of the CSMP Server and the CSMP Agent
 *
 * - The CSMP Server acts on requests of the Network Management System (NMS) 
 * - The CSMP Agent sends requests to the NMS
 *
 * The typical flow initiated by the Agent:
 * 1. Register with NMS
 * 2. Provide Device Capabilities to NMS
 * 3. Obtain configuration from NMS
 * 4. Periodically report performance metrics to the NMS.
 *
 * The CSMP server (after registration)
 * 1. responds on requests of the NMS which can be:
 *      - Respond to subsequent configuration readsand updates.
 *      - Respond to on-demand performance metric requests from the NMS
 *      - Report asynchronousevents to the NMS as they occur.
 *      - Respond to logged event requests from the NMS.
 *      - Act on command requests from the NMS, including firmware transfer and activation.
 *
 *
 * \section install_sec Configuration
 * The configuration of the example is done via the csmp_info.h file.
 * This file contains the global variables that match the device responses on NMS requests.
 * These values are fixed in the example.
 * Real implementations needs to make sure that the values reported are actual values from the CSMP device.
 *
 *
 * \section struct_sec Code Structure
 * The code is build up:
 * \verbatim
   -----------------------------    ----
  |       Example Application   |     |
  +--------------+--------------+     |
  | CSMP Server  |  CSMP Agent  |     |
  +--------------+--------------+     |  C code
  |   Server     |   Client     |     |
  +-----------------------------+     |
  |            CoAP             |     |
  +-----------------------------+   ----
  |  pthread, semaphores        |     Linux
  -------------------------------
  \endverbatim
 *
 * The CSMP server and Agent are using global variables (structs).
 * The global variables are encoded/decoded to the protobuf TLV.
 * The TLVs are used in the request and response payloads.
 *
 * The example application has a callback handler csmptlvs_get() for the received GET CoAP Method call.
 * The example application has a callback handler csmptlvs_post() for the received POST CoAP method call.
 * Each handler function will call according to the supplied TLV the appropriate GET/POST TLV function.
 * This function sets the appropriate global variable on the wanted value, e.g. this call can be extended to read/write from the actual hardware.
 * The global variable is then passed down the stack and will be converted in to the protobuf TLV before passing it into the CoAP stack.
 *
 * \section struct_endpoints End points in the system
 *
 * NMS endpoints, e.g. where the CSMP Agent interacts with:
 * - <base-url>/r - registration
 * - <base-url>/c - configuration
 *
 * Device configuration endpoints, e.g. where the NMS Client interacts with:
 * - <base-url>/c
 * - <base-url>/c/<tlvid>
 * - <base-url>/c/<tlvid>/<index>
